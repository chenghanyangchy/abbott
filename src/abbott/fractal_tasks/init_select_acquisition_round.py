    """Initialized select acquisition for label upsampling task

    This task prepares a parallelization list of all zarr_urls that need to be
    used to upsample the label image.
    This task only works for HCS OME-Zarrs for 2 reasons: Only HCS OME-Zarrs
    currently have defined acquisition metadata to determine reference
    acquisitions. And we have only implemented the grouping of images for
    HCS OME-Zarrs by well (with the assumption that every well just has 1
    image per acqusition).

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        reference_acquisition: Which acquisition contains the label image to
            upsample. Needs to match the acquisition metadata in the OME-Zarr
            image.

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
