    Advanced Stardist Model Parameters
    
    Attributes:
        sparse: If true, aggregate probabilities/distances sparsely during tiled
            prediction to save memory (recommended)
        prob_thresh: Consider only object candidates from pixels with predicted 
            object probability above this threshold.
        nms_thresh: Perform non-maximum suppression (NMS) that 
            considers two objects to be the same when their area/surface 
            overlap exceeds this threshold.
        scale: Scale the input image internally by a tuple of floats and rescale 
            the output accordingly. Useful if the Stardist model has been trained 
            on images with different scaling. E.g. (z, y, x) = (1.0, 0.5, 0.5).
        n_tiles : Out of memory (OOM) errors can occur if the input image is too large.
            To avoid this problem, the input image is broken up into (overlapping) tiles
            that are processed independently and re-assembled. This parameter denotes a 
            tuple of the number of tiles for every image axis. E.g. (z, y, x) = (2, 4, 4).
        show_tile_progress: Whether to show progress during tiled prediction.
        verbose: Whether to print some info messages.
        predict_kwargs: Keyword arguments for ``predict`` function of Keras model.
        nms_kwargs: Keyword arguments for non-maximum suppression.
